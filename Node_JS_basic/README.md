## NodeJS Basics


## Project Overview:

This project is designed to help you gain foundational skills in developing server-side applications using Node.js and related technologies. It's aimed at beginners with some JavaScript knowledge.

## Learning Objectives:

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Execute JavaScript code directly on your computer using Node.js.
Work with modules, which are reusable blocks of code that provide specific functionalities in your Node.js applications.
Employ Node.js modules for file operations, like reading data from CSV files.
Interact with the command line and environment variables using the process module.
Construct basic and more complex HTTP servers using Node.js and the Express.js framework.
Leverage ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), a modern version of JavaScript, in your Node.js projects with the help of Babel.
Utilize Nodemon, a development tool that automatically restarts your Node.js application whenever you make changes to your code, streamlining the development process.


## Project Requirements:

Code Editors: You can use any of these text editors for coding: vi, vim, emacs, or Visual Studio Code.
Development Environment: Your code will be executed and tested in a virtual environment running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Node.js version 20.x.x.
File Naming: Ensure all your code files have the .js extension.

## Project Structure:
Create a README.md file at the project's root directory, providing an overview and instructions.
Organize your code in well-named JavaScript files.

## Testing and Linting:
Your code will be evaluated using Jest, a testing framework, and the npm run test command.
Code style will be checked using ESLint, a linter tool.
To run all tests and linting checks, execute npm run full-test.

## Code Export:
All your functions and classes must be exported using the format module.exports = myFunction;.

## Provided Files:
database.csv: A CSV file containing sample data (user information).
package.json: A file that lists the project's dependencies and scripts.
Configuration files for Babel (babel.config.js) and ESLint (.eslintrc.js): These files provide settings for code transpilation (Babel) and code style checking (ESLint), respectively.

## Setup Steps (Important):

Install Node.js and npm: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/) to get Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
Clone or Download the Project Files: Obtain the project files (code, configuration files, etc.) and place them in a directory on your computer.
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute npm install. This command will install the necessary libraries listed in package.json that your project relies on.
Now you're ready to start working on the project's requirements!

## Additional Tips:

Refer to the provided resources (Node.js getting started guide, tutorials on modules, specific modules, process, Express, ES6 with Babel, Nodemon) to learn more about the concepts involved.
Take advantage of online tutorials, documentation, and communities (like Stack Overflow) for Node.js development if you encounter difficulties.
Feel free to experiment and explore beyond the project requirements to broaden your understanding.
