### What ES6 is
ES6, or ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript language specification. It introduced significant updates and new features to JavaScript, aiming to make it more powerful and easier to use.

### New features introduced in ES6
ES6 introduced a range of new features, including:
- Block-scoped variables (`let` and `const`)
- Arrow functions
- Default function parameters
- Template literals
- Destructuring assignments
- Rest and spread operators
- Classes
- Modules
- Promises
- Enhanced object literals
- Symbols
- Iterators and generators
- `for-of` loops
- New built-in methods for objects, arrays, and strings

### The difference between a constant and a variable
A variable declared with `var` or `let` can be reassigned to a different value. A constant declared with `const` cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment. Constants provide a way to declare variables that are meant to remain unchanged throughout the program.

### Block-scoped variables
Block-scoped variables are declared using `let` and `const`, which means they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by `{}`) in which they are defined. This contrasts with `var`, which is function-scoped or globally scoped.

### Arrow functions and function parameters default to them
Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions and lexically bind the `this` value, which makes them particularly useful for writing concise functions without worrying about the context of `this`.

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// Default parameters
const greet = (name = 'Guest') => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

### Rest and spread function parameters
The rest operator (`...`) allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

```javascript
function sum(...args) {
    return args.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
}
```

The spread operator (`...`) allows an iterable (like an array) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4, 5];
```

### String templating in ES6
String templating in ES6 is done using template literals, which are enclosed by backticks (`` ` ``). They allow for embedded expressions using `${expression}` and can span multiple lines.

```javascript
const name = 'John';
const message = `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to ES6.`;
```

### Object creation and their properties in ES6
ES6 introduced shorthand syntax for defining object properties and methods.

```javascript
const name = 'John';
const age = 25;

const person = {
    name, // shorthand for name: name
    age,  // shorthand for age: age
    greet() { // shorthand for greet: function() { ... }
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
    }
};
```

### Iterators and for-of loops
Iterators are objects that provide a `next()` method, which returns the next item in a sequence. The `for-of` loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, and sets.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (const value of arr) {
    console.log(value); // 1, 2, 3
}
```

These features together make ES6 a powerful upgrade to JavaScript, enhancing its usability and performance.
